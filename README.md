A new training project consisting in cloning a Deliveroo page.
The main goal was to use the useEffect hook and create a whole page based on backend server datas hosted on Heroku (recovered with an axios request and then iterate on it to give a better look on the different datas), and to make a cart system.

### Main features :

- useState hook
- useEffect hook
- axios request
- mapping
- full responsive
- menu and cart.

### Backend is here : https://github.com/Julien-Allard/deliveroo-backend
